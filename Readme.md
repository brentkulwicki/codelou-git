This project is a fantasy baseball draft application for a fantasy baseball league I play in.
Our league does some odd features that doesn't allow us to use other software out there including:
- we do a non-snake draft (meaning team 1 gets the first pick of every round)
- we have keepers, but not every team has the same number of keepers
- our keepers are kept in the round they were previously drafted

Directions:
To use this app, bring all files down locally and then open the index.html file
The app will pull stats information from MLB's website for a searched player. Type all or part
of a player's last name into the 'last name' input in the 'player search' section and then click
the 'search' button.  A list of players will appear at the bottom of the 'player search' section.
You will then click the desired player from the list to display their stats information. 
Once the player's stats are being displayed, you can either select a team and round from the two dropdowns that the player is to be kept in and hit the 'enter keeper' button OR hit the 'draft player' button. NOTE: once you input a player using the 'draft player' button, the draft has started and you will no longer be able to enter keepers.
